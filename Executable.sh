# 1. This file allows you to run a set of commands through one command: sh ./Executable.sh
# 2. To call this command using a single letter, type alias r="sh ./Executable.sh" in the terminal then enter
# 3. Finally type r into the terminal then enter to run the command
# DISCLAIMER: aliases do not persist when the terminal has ended so you have to repeat steps 2-3 for new terminals
